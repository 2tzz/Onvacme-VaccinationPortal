                        <h2>What is the vaccines?</h2>
                        <p>Vaccines differ from other medical drugs in two important ways. The first is that they are designed to prevent disease, rather than treat it. They do this by priming a person’s immune system to recognise a specific disease-causing bacteria, virus or other pathogen. This “memory” can last years, or in some cases for life, which is why vaccination can be so effective, stopping people from getting sick rather than waiting until disease occurs. The second is that vaccines by their nature tend to be biological products, rather than chemical like most drugs. This not only means that the processes involved in making them are usually more complex and expensive, but also that they tend to be less stable than chemicals and more vulnerable to temperature changes. Because of this, vaccines normally need to be refrigerated to keep them within a specific temperature range. The type of vaccine will determine how low a temperature the vaccine needs to be stored at. Most vaccines need to be kept refrigerated or frozen, but intranasal vaccines are now being developed that can be stored at room temperature.</p>

                        <h2>How do vaccines work?</h2>
                        <p>Vaccines prime the immune system to detect a particular virus or bacteria by showing it a harmless version of the pathogen, or part of it – much like giving a bloodhound a rag to sniff – so that it can remember it and is able to mount a defence if the person ever becomes infected. They typically do this by stimulating the production of antibodies, which are proteins made by our bodies to fight disease. This can also help stimulate other parts of our immune defences, such as T cells. This is the basic premise for how all vaccines work; precisely how they achieve this can vary significantly. Some vaccines involve introducing a whole but inactivated (or a whole, live but shortened version) – and therefore safe – version of the germ into the body, while others contain only a specific part (such as a single protein normally found on the surface of the pathogen). In all cases, the aim is to get specific antibody-generating particles, or antigens, such as a protein found on the pathogen, to trigger a strong immune reaction. Some newer forms of vaccine don’t contain the antigen itself, but instead a piece of genetic code for it. When this goes into our body,</p>

                        <h2>How are vaccines tested?</h2>
                        <p>Vaccines go through a rigorous process of testing before they are used in the general population. Once researchers have found a promising candidate, they put it through pre-clinical studies, usually testing it on animals to assess its safety and potential to prevent disease. If a vaccine passes that test, it goes into phase 1 trials, where it is given to a small group of people to confirm its safety in humans, to see if it triggers an immune response and to figure out the dosage. In phase 2 trials, the vaccine is given to a larger group (usually hundreds) of volunteers to see whether the immune response triggered is strong enough, and whether there are any side effects. In this phase, the volunteers are divided into two groups, one which gets the vaccine and one which gets a placebo. In phase 3 trials, the vaccine candidate is given to thousands of volunteers, again divided in two groups as for phase 2 trials.</p>
